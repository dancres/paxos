      <p>This failure detector implementation can be used with any comms stack so long as it can provide an instance of
      <code>org.dancres.paxos.Transport</code> to use.</p>
      <p>Create a <code>FailureDetectorImpl</code> and <code>Heartbeater</code> pair per node in the cluster and route
      all received <code>Heartbeat</code> instances to the local <code>FailureDetectorImpl</code>. Addressing
      information or other meta-data may be passed via the Heartbeats and used for e.g. locating the current leader
      which would be achieved by arranging for each node's metadata to be the "public facing" address used by clients.
      When the paxos implementation flags other leader, the included nodeId would be used to obtain the metadata
      which would then be passed back to the client. Note: It is possible for the "public facing" address to be
      the same as that of the leader nodes if suitable packet (de)multiplexing is performed.</p>
